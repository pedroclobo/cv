# Curriculum Vitae

This repository contains my personal curriculum vitae.
It is available [here](https://github.com/pedroclobo/cv/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf) in pdf format.

## Compiling Locally

To compile the pdf locally, `typst` need to be installed.

The pdf can then be compiled by running the following command:

```bash
typst compile cv.typ
```
